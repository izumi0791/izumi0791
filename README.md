- ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I created this account coz I'm curious about the Next.js conference. Said I could claim with a Github account to make my conference pass look cooler. So yeah, here I am!

- Also I'm a failed programmer. I don't really have any plans on what am gonna do here. Maybe I'll tinker with stuff, who knows?

- If you spent your time reading senseless thing like this, thanks.
